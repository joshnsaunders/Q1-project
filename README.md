# EnRollMe.Info

This website overlays school location, using google maps API, with school performance data. The user can then search for schools with higher performance and also search for just elementary, middle of high schools.They can also search by performance and/or organization (Charter Management Organization).

## Javascript, jQuery and CSS Grid

I used a lot of javascript and jQuery to implement the search functionality. I also used custom map icons
with a google maps hover event to show the performance data for each school. The click events are powered
by jQuery as well. I also used CSS that was layed out using grid.

### Sidebar Search

The sidebar allows the user to search by performance, type or organization individually as well as
performance and type or performance and organization.

### Color Keys

The blue, green, yellow, orange and red divs on the top of the sidebar are clickable and provide information about what each of the colors mean as far as school performance, with blue being the best
and red being the worst as ranked by a Denver Public Schools framework.

## Deployment

I used firebase to deply the project.
